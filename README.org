* Installation and Configuration
This project relies on [[https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request][emacs-request]] and [[https://github.com/skeeto/emacsql][emacsql]]. Please install them in advanced.

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/chenyanming/wallabag.el.git ~/.emacs.d/lisp/wallabag/
#+end_src

** require
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/wallabag/")
(require 'wallabag)
(setq wallabag-host "https://xx.xx.xx") ;; wallabag server host name
(setq wallabag-username "xx") ;; username
(setq wallabag-password "xx") ;; password
(setq wallabag-clientid "xx") ;; created with API clients management
(setq wallabag-secret "xx") ;; created with API clients management
(setq wallabag-search-print-items '("title" "domain" "tag" "reading-time" "date")) ;; control what content should be show in *wallabag-search*
(setq wallabag-search-page-max-rows 32) ;; how many items shown in one page
#+END_SRC

** use-package (load-path)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package wallabag
  :defer t
  :load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/wallabag/"
  :config
  (setq wallabag-host "https://xx.xx.xx") ;; wallabag server host name
  (setq wallabag-username "xx") ;; username
  (setq wallabag-password "xx") ;; password

  ;; (setq wallabag-db-file "~/OneDrive/Org/wallabag.sqlite") ;; optional, default is saved to ~/.emacs.d/.cache/wallabag.sqlite
  )
#+end_src

** use-package (Straight)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package wallabag
  :straight (:host github :repo "chenyanming/wallabag.el" :files ("*.el" "*.alist" "*.css")))
#+end_src

** Doom Emacs (package!)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! wallabag :recipe (:host github :repo "chenyanming/wallabag.el" :files ("*.el" "*.alist" "*.css")))
#+end_src
** Store sensitive credentials in ~auth-sources~
It is insecure to store your sensitive credentials such as the wallabag password and client secret
in plain text, and especially if you want to be upload it to public servers. You can use Emacs'
built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/auth.html][auth-sources]] library for GPG-encrypted storage of your secrets.

Create an encrypted =~/.authinfo.gpg= file with the lines:
#+begin_src
machine wallabag domain "https://example.com" user "xxx" password "xxx" clientid "xxx" client-secret "xxx"
#+end_src

Wallabag will get the credentials when needed without saving them in memory. 

You can also hardcode ~wallabag-host~, ~wallabag-username~, ~wallabag-password~, ~wallabag-clientid~, ~wallabag-secret~ but it is less secure.

* Image Caching
Wallabag will not download the images, but using Emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/url/Disk-Caching.html][disk caching]] capability. Setting ~url-automatic-caching~ non-nil causes documents to be cached automatically.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq url-automatic-caching t)
#+end_src

* Retrieve new entries after =M-x wallabag=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'wallabag-after-render-hook 'wallabag-search-update-and-clear-filter)
#+end_src


* Use org-protocol to save page
Add wallabag org protocol by running:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(wallabag-org-setup-org-protocol)
#+end_src

Create a bookmarklet with:
- If [[https://www.piwheels.org/project/emacs-paw/][paw-server]] is running, use [[file:js/wallabag_insert_entry.js]] (send html to paw-server, and save the page to wallabag)
- If [[https://www.piwheels.org/project/emacs-paw/][paw-server]] is not running, use [[file:js/wallabag_add_entry.js]] (only send url to wallabag server)

* Use AI to generate summary
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x wallabag-summary ;; or press ?
#+end_src
Wallabag will use gptel to generate the summary add overlay into the article.

* Keybindings
Start with ~M-x wallabag~. 
For the first time you connect to server, you need to press ~u~ to synchronize.

PS: 
1. The synchronization algorithm is still on development, if you want to keep local database always updated, please use ~wallabag-full-update~.
