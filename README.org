* Known Bugs
There is one issue is that entries deletion on other platforms can not sync to emacs, the workaround is doing a full update via ~M-x wallabag-full-update~.

The mobile client also has the same behavior, when deletion performs on web client or wallabag.el, you need to do a full update on mobile.

* Installation and Configuration
This project relies on [[https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request][emacs-request]] and [[https://github.com/skeeto/emacsql][emacsql]]. Please install them in advanced.
